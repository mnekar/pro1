                   ESSAY WRITING
Often , and for the best of the motives, our problems in essay writing begin the very minute we are given a question.Anxious to get with the work and not fall 
behind, we skip the interpretation stage and launch straight into our research.
As a result we raed resources,take notes without a clear idea of what is 
relevant,beyond some very general idea of the subject of the essay.Then finally, after hours of toil,tired and frustrated and no clear about what we're left 
with a file of irrelevant,unusable notes.
